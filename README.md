Hello,

Thank you for your interest on working with us on our research team.
As mentioned during your interview, we put together a homework project so that you can showoff your skills as a software developer and researcher.
We are sending this email to you as well as to the other candidates. We are expecting to receive your version committed to GitHub by Monday Nov. 4th.
We will evaluate your project and make a decision on which one of you we think is the best candidate to fulfill for the available position.

The project: We would like you to write web-based a tic-tac-toe game. 1

To build it you can use your own imagination and push it as far as you think is fair for a few hours homework. This are ideas that come to my mind right now:

-	The game should have some kind of UI where the player (or players) place their moves.
-	There could be certain intelligence where the computer recognize if and when a player had won.
-	Also it could have some mechanism to remember who wont previous games and keep scores for either the current session or on a more permanent storage.
-	Having the computer to suggest moves or even to play against a human peer would be kind of cool.

You can also use different languages, frameworks and technologies, keeping in mind that for this specific role you are applying for you’ll be expected to use a combination of: 

-	React / JavaScript
-	C# / .NET
-	MSSQL / Databases
-	Web APIs / Web APPs

Of course to complete this task you don’t have to use all of them.

If you choose to use React, you can use the initial code on this repository. 

Once you are satisfied with your solution, please send us the URL to your new GitHub repository.

Thank you for your time and effort and good luck.

All the best,
Alexiel Mejias
