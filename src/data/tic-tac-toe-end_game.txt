This database encodes the complete set of possible board configurations at the end of tic-tac-toe games, 
where “x” is assumed to have played first. 
The target concept is “win for x” (i.e., true when “x” has one of 8 possible ways to create a “three-in-a-row”).

tenth is class attribute which contains information if x player won.

    ML : middle left square {x,o,b}
    MM : middle middle square {x,o,b}
    MR : middle right square {x,o,b}
    BL : bottom left square {x,o,b}
    BM : bottom middle square {x,o,b}
